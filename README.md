# comics-downloader
I made a python program to download comics from https://readcomiconline.li/ in cbr/png format.

Instructions for installation:
1. Install all modules from requirements.txt with the command **pip install -r requirements.txt**
2. Install Google Chrome browser from **https://www.google.com/chrome/**
3. Install ChromeDriver from **https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/ **

***GOOGLE CHROME AND CHROMEDRIVER MUST BE THE SAME VERSION!!***
